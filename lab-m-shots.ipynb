    "###  Introduction  \n",
    "The goal of this experiment was to explore how few-shot prompts influence a language model's ability to adapt to different tasks. By designing three creative prompt versions, I tested whether the model could generalize to new scenarios based on limited examples.  \n",

    "1 **Movie Genre Classifier** – Identifies movie genres from short descriptions.  \n",
    "2 **Historical Event Summarizer** – Guesses the year of a historical event based on a brief summary.  \n",
    "3 **Sports Champion Predictor** – Predicts a sports team's future performance from contextual hints.  \n",

    "###  Results  \n",
    "\n",
    " **Movie Genre Classifier:**  \n",
    "- **Success:** Correctly labeled \"A detective hunts a serial killer through a gritty city\" as **Thriller** (even though I didn't provide a thriller example).  \n",
    "- **Challenge:** It struggled when I gave a more abstract description like \"A journey through the human mind's subconscious.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    " **Historical Event Summarizer:**  \n",
    "- **Success:** Guessed **1991** for \"The Soviet Union dissolved,\" which is impressive given the close match.  \n",
    "- **Challenge:** When given a broader event like \"The Renaissance flourished in Europe,\" it returned **1500s** but didn’t specify a more accurate year.  \n",
    "\n",
    " **Sports Champion Predictor:**  \n",
    "- **Success:** Gave a nuanced answer for \"A team with aging stars but strong tactics,\" predicting \"They’ll reach the playoffs but might fall short in the finals.\"  \n",
    "- **Challenge:** Overly optimistic when I gave a weaker team's description — suggesting they’d \"surprise everyone.\"  \n",

    "###  Key Takeaways  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Few-shot examples work best when they cover diverse cases** — narrow prompts confuse the model.  \n",
    "- **Tone and style matter:** More conversational prompts produced more natural responses.  \n",
    "- **Failures showed bias:** The sports predictor leaned toward optimistic predictions, showing how prompt wording can shape responses.  \n",

    "###  Conclusion  \n",
    "The experiment proved that few-shot learning is powerful but requires well-thought examples. Ambiguous descriptions led to errors, and the model often preferred optimistic or familiar answers — teaching me the importance of balanced, clear, and varied examples.  \n",
