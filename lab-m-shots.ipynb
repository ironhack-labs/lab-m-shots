    "This experiment explores different prompting techniques to analyze how AI models respond to queries about Oscar winners. The study examines three approaches: Few-Shot Learning, Instruction-Based Prompting, and Open-Ended Conversational Prompting. The objective is to determine which method provides the most accurate, well-structured, and reliable responses.\n",

    "Findings & Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Few-Shot Learning with Structured Examples\n",
    "✅ Strengths: The model successfully followed the given format when provided with prior examples.\n",
    "❌ Weaknesses: If the model lacked relevant training data, it sometimes misinterpreted the pattern or extrapolated incorrect information.\n",
    "2. Instruction-Based Prompting (Direct Formatting)\n",
    "✅ Strengths: The model attempted to follow the specified format without needing examples.\n",
    "❌ Weaknesses: It occasionally deviated from the exact structure, requiring more explicit instructions.\n",
    "3. Open-Ended Conversational Prompting\n",
    "✅ Strengths: Provided a detailed and engaging response, useful for context-rich discussions.\n",
    "❌ Weaknesses: Increased risk of hallucination, where the model generated incorrect or speculative information.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Challenges & Issues Identified ** \n",
    "- The model hallucinated when asked about future Oscar winners (e.g., \"Who won Best Actor at the Oscars 2025?\").\n",
    "Instruction-based prompts were less reliable in maintaining strict formatting.\n",
    "Few-shot learning required careful curation of examples to avoid bias or incorrect extrapolation.\n",
    "Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- Few-shot learning is the most effective approach for structured outputs.\n",
    "Explicit constraints (e.g., \"Only provide officially announced winners\") help prevent hallucination.\n",
    "Instruction-based prompting needs careful wording to ensure consistency.\n",
    "Conversational prompts work well for storytelling but are prone to errors.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- This experiment highlights the importance of prompt engineering in AI interactions. Depending on the use case, choosing the right prompting technique can significantly improve accuracy and reliability. Future enhancements could include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the AI references real-time data to avoid outdated or incorrect responses."
