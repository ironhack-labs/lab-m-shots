    "For the prompts as a literature expert, I experiemented with zero-shot inference and few-shots inference to see the difference. In both cases the bot could give me the answer to my question, however, with zero-shot, the answer came in the form of a long drawn out answer that provides a lot of extraneous information about the book that I didn't ask for, whereas with few-shots, the answer was correct, and in the format of the inference references provided. So it clearly learned which information was specifically being asked for, which demonstrates that is learned by example of how to answer a question that is asked this way. When prompted with few-shot examples of literature, but asked about pizza instead, it behaves like a bot would in the context of zero-shot prompts. The role of literature expert does not hinder the bot from describing pizza to me, which makes me think the role parameter might be made obsolete. To test this theory, I prompted the bot to be an expert in pizza and then gave few shot examples of literature, and then asked it a question about literature. Because it's expertise is pizza and not literature, it did not learn to answer the question in the format provided. Instead it gives a description of the book long-form, like it did with pizza and the other zero-shot examples. This makes me think that when the role and shots are in conflict the shots are also disregarded. Interestingly, in this example the bot makes a contradiction about this tween drug propaganda book, saying that the book is a diary that is a work of fiction made up by the auther, and then saying it is based on the the story of a real girl. I experimented more with roles and shots and in the end tried to mix it up to see if the mixing the role as a pizza literature expert would make the chatbot respond creatively, however instead it narrowly replied \"As this book does not focus on pizza or pizza toppings, there is no information regarding pizza toppings for \"It Happened to Nancy.\" Creativity is a limit within the model we have created."
