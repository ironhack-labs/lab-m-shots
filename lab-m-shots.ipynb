    "1. **Response Consistency:**\n",
    "The multi-turn approach (Version 2) resulted in the most consistent output, as the model had multiple reinforcement examples. However, if the examples were too many or contradictory, it could lead to slight hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Formatting Adherence:**\n",
    "Explicit instructions (Version 3) helped enforce a strict output format, but the model sometimes provided additional text outside the desired code block. This highlights the importance of fine-tuning instructions to reduce verbosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complexity vs. Simplicity:**\n",
    "The one-shot prompt (Version 1) was simple and effective for straightforward queries. For more complex queries or domains with nuanced outputs, incorporating more examples (as in Version 2) is beneficial."
