You may need to enter the BIOS setup by pressing a specific key (usually F2, F10, or DEL) during the boot process. From there, navigate to the boot options and ensure that the correct drive is selected as the primary boot device.\n",

      "3. **Check for external devices**: Sometimes, external devices like USB drives or external hard drives can interfere with the boot process. Try disconnecting all external devices except for the essential ones (keyboard, mouse, and monitor) and see if that helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Run Windows Startup Repair**: If you have a Windows installation disc or USB drive, you can use it to run the Startup Repair tool. Boot from the installation media and select the Repair Your Computer option to access the Startup Repair tool, which can automatically fix certain issues preventing Windows from booting.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Boot into Safe Mode**: If your PC is having trouble booting normally, try booting into Safe Mode. To do this, restart your PC and repeatedly press the F8 key (or Shift + F8 in some cases) during the boot process. From there, you can troubleshoot potential issues that may be causing the boot problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Check for hardware issues**: If none of the above steps work, there may be a hardware issue causing the problem. You can try removing and reseating components like RAM sticks, graphics cards, and cables to ensure everything is properly connected. If you suspect a hardware issue, it may be best to consult with a professional or bring your PC to a repair shop for further diagnosis.\n",

    "# Results and Findings\n",
    "The experiments conducted with the SQL-based bot yielded positive results. One of the most notable findings is that there were no hallucinations in the generated SQL queries throughout testing. This indicates that the prompt modifications and clear schema instructions have successfully guided the model to produce accurate and reliable SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Findings:\n",
    "The model consistently generated correct SQL queries based on the provided schema.\n",
    "Prompt adjustments, such as emphasizing key calculations (e.g., revenue = price * quantity), ensured that the model handled more complex queries effectively.\n",
    "The absence of hallucinations shows that the SQL-based approach and prompt structure offer a robust solution for querying dynamic data without errors.\n",
    "These results suggest that the current setup is highly reliable for retrieving accurate information from the database and can scale effectively as the database or queries grow in complexity."
