    "\n",
    "# Effectiveness:\n",
    "\n",
    "# All prompts worked well with clear examples. The model adhered to the format when examples were unambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The recipe prompt occasionally produced generic steps if ingredients were too broad (e.g., \"vegetables\").\n",

    "# Hallucinations/Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the movie recommendation task, the model once recommended Mad Max: \n",
    "# Fury Road for The Dark Knight without a clear thematic link.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For a poorly structured prompt (missing colons), the model ignored the format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Clarity is critical: Examples must explicitly define the structure (e.g., colons, line breaks).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Balance specificity: Too few examples or vague inputs reduce reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adaptability: GPT-3.5 generalizes well from minimal examples but struggles with overly abstract tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion:\n",
    "# Few-shot learning is powerful for structured outputs, but success depends on example quality and specificity.\n",
    "#  Testing multiple variants helps identify optimal prompt designs."
