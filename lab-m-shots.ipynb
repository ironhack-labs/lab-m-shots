    "- **Objective**: The goal of this analysis was to evaluate how well GPT classifies product review sentiments (positive or negative) and assigns ratings based on the review content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    " -  Sentiment Classification:\n",
    "         - GPT successfully identified positive and negative sentiments in clear reviews. For example, in the review \"This cleanser is too harsh for my skin, and it made it dry and flaky,\" GPT correctly identified it as negative.\n",
    "In reviews with neutral or mixed feelings, such as \"I don’t know, I feel I will give it some time,\" GPT correctly labeled the sentiment as neutral, but sometimes struggled with nuanced sentiments that weren't clearly positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Sentiment and Justification:\n",
    "    -  When the task included justifications, GPT was able to explain its sentiment classification. For example, it identified the review \"This moisturizer left my skin feeling soft and hydrated all day!\" as positive and explained that the user was satisfied.\n",
    "This additional explanation helped make the classification clearer, though it could sometimes be verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Sentiment and Rating:\n",
    "   - GPT was able to assign ratings based on the sentiment expressed in the review. For example, a review expressing strong satisfaction was given a 5/5 rating.\n"
